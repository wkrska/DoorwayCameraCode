# DoorwayCameraCode
This repo contains everything you need to replicate the results found in the main document and supplemental document. 
[doorway_camera.m](./doorway_camera.m) is the main function that will perform the reconstrution. It requires several parameters to be passed into it in order to perform the reconstrution. 

[run_doorway_camera.m](./run_doorway_camera.m) has all the function calls needed to run each reconstruction shown in the main document and supplemenary document. This file also explains in detail what each parameter is. NOTE: Each reconstruction takes about 15 minutes to run on a moderately powerful consumer CPU given our chosen parameters. 

To run reconstructions on new data, simply create a new folder in the same format as one of the examples, and add the filepath to the switch-block(s) in [doorway_camera.m](./doorway_camera.m)
